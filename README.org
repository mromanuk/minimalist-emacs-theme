* Minimalist Emacs Theme

This is a forked theme, the original (which I love) was done by [[https://github.com/zaiste/zaiste-emacs-theme][Zeiste]],  also:
It is a spin-off from the [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][Doom One Light]] theme and remotly inspired by [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=uloco.theme-bluloco-light][Bluloco]]
by [[https://uloco.github.io/][Umut TopuzoÄŸlu]].

** Install

Put the ~minimalist-theme~ inside your ~/.doom.d/themes/~ and then add the
following line to your ~config.el~:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq
 doom-theme 'minimalist
 ;; the rest of your config ...
 )
#+end_src

I'm still figuring out the how to create an Emacs (or an Emacs Doom) theme. Feel
free to issue a PR with a proper, more idiomatic method.
